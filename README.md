## Usage ‚ö°

To run the code locally, clone the project and run:

```bash
cargo run
```

This will execute the [visualization demo](./src/bin/macroquad-demo.rs) locally

## Configuration ‚öô

Several parameters/constants of the simulation can be changed including:
 
* Lattice Grid Dimensions
* Lattice Density Distribution (to influence directional Flow)
* Boundary Objects
* Simulation Step Size

## Motivation ü§î

A dead-simple implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method with as few dependencies as possible in my favorite programming language ü¶Ä.

> The lattice Boltzmann method is an application of Boltzmann particle (microscopic) principles in a lattice grid to simulate computation fluid dynamics (CFD) without directly solving the Navier-Stokes equations (macroscopic)
